For access to the database in Firebase and the Google Sheet, go to the word document in my coop work folder under SashTesting. Here, you'll see a google accout with a username and password that will give you access to everything you need. After logging in, go to the Google Sheets homepage to access the sheet, and use this link, https://work-5b7b6.firebaseio.com/, to access the database. Feel free to share yourself into the database or the sheet after if you'd like to work from your own Google account!
